== Introduction

Sqlg primary challenge is to reduce latency by combining TinkerPop
{tinkerpop-docs}#graph-traversal-steps[steps] into as few database calls as possible.
Without a significant reduction in latency the fine-grained nature of graph traversals has a prohibitively high performance impact.

Sqlg supports various bulk modes to reduce latency when modifying the graph.

[NOTE]
Hsqldb and H2 do not suffer the same latency as Postgresql and MariaDB as it runs embedded in the jvm.
