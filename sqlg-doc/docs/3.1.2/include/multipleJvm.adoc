== Multiple JVMs

It is possible to run many Sqlg instances pointing to the same underlying database. These instances can be in the same jvm
but is primarily intended for separate jvm(s) pointing to the same underlying database.

To make multiple graphs point to the same underlying database it is important to add in the `distributed` property to `sqlg.properties`.

.sqlg.properties
----
distributed = true
----

[NOTE]
Multiple JVMs is only supported for Postgresql.
Hsqldb and H2 are primarily intended to run embedded so multiple JVMs do not make sense for them.
Multiple JVM support has not been implemented for MariaDB and MSSqlServer.

Postgresql's https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html[*notify*] mechanism is used to distribute the cached schema
across multiple JVMs.
