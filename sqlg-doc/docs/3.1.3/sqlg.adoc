https://github.com/pietermartin/sqlg[*Sqlg*] image:github/SVG/mark-github.svg[] is a implementation of http://tinkerpop.apache.org/[Apache TinkerPop] on a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system[RDBMS].
Currently http://www.postgresql.org/[Postgresql], http://hsqldb.org/[HSQLDB], http://h2database.com[H2], https://mariadb.org[MariaDB], https://www.mysql.com[MySQL] are supported.

Sqlg has a github https://github.com/pietermartin/sqlg/discussions[discussions] page.

== Gremlin

Sqlg optimizes a gremlin link:{tinkerpop-docs}#traversal[`traversal`]  by analyzing the
link:{tinkerpop-docs}#graph-traversal-steps[`steps`] and where possible combining them into custom Sqlg steps. This can
significantly reduce the number of database calls.

Sqlg has two strategies for optimizing TinkerPop steps.

 * Starting with the link:{tinkerpop-docs}#graph-step[`GraphStep`],
consecutive optimizable steps are folded into link:{apidocs}org/umlg/sqlg/step/SqlgGraphStep.html[`SqlgGraphStep`]. This
stops at the first unoptimizable step after which the second strategy is used.
* The second strategy is to `barrier` the incoming elements to the unoptimizable step. This means to exhaust the traversal/iterator
up to the step and cache all the incoming elements for this step. From here the step is executed for all the incoming
elements at once. This strategy effectively changes the semantics to a breath first retrieval.

[NOTE]
Turn sql logging on by setting `log4j.logger.org.umlg.sqlg=debug`

=== Optimization (strategy 1)

The following steps are optimized.

* <<Graph Step>>
* <<Vertex Step>>
* <<Has Step>>
* <<Or Step>>
* <<And Step>>
* <<Not Step>>
* <<Repeat Step>>
* <<Optional Step>>
* <<Choose Step>>
* <<Order Step>>
* <<Range Step>>
* <<Limit Step>>
* <<Drop Step>>
* <<Reducing Steps>>

The combined step will then in turn generate the sql statements to retrieve the data.
It attempts to retrieve the data in as few distinct sql statements as possible.

==== Reducing Steps

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/meanStep.adoc[]

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/countStep.adoc[]

===== Group By

link:{tinkerpop-docs}#group-step[`Group Step`]'s are optimized with sql's `group by` clause.

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/groupByMinStep.adoc[]

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/groupByMaxStep.adoc[]

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/groupBySumStep.adoc[]

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/groupByMeanStep.adoc[]

include::{includedir}/gremlin/strategy1/reducing/groupByCountStep.adoc[]

=== Optimization (strategy 2)

The following steps are optimized.

* <<Vertex Step>>
* <<Repeat Step>>
* <<Optional Step>>
* <<Choose Step>>
* <<Local Step>>
* <<And Step>>
* <<Or Step>>
* <<Not Step>>
* <<Where Step>>

The combined step will then in turn generate the sql statements to retrieve the data.
It attempts to retrieve the data in as few distinct sql statements as possible.
